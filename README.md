# Wordle
Python Code to play wordle and help find out the best guess based on information theory

Inspired by the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&t=149s) from the [threeblueonebrown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) channel,
the two sets of python jupyter notebooks were created.

The first [notebook] (Find_Words.ipynb) helps to play the game, but finding the words, after the first guess, with the highest information.

The second [notebook] (WORDLE_GAME.ipynb) plays the game on its own, a game with a custom answer or set of games on its own.
