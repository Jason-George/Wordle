# Wordle
Python Code to play wordle and help find out the best guess based on information theory

Inspired by the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&t=149s) from the [threeblueonebrown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) channel,
the two sets of python jupyter notebooks were created.

The first [notebook](Find_Words.ipynb) helps to playing worlde, finding the words with the highest information and also the probability that a certain word is the answer,as the game progresses.

The second [notebook](WORDLE_GAME.ipynb) plays the game on its own or a game with a choosen custom answer.
